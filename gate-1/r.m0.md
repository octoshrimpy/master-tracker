# R.M0: instructions begin

On 11/21, photos of a card bundled with merch began to circulate.
The card contained BASIC-esque code on one side and a message from MatPat on the other.

The side with BASIC code, identified by the multiples of ten used as line numbers, explains very concisely the rules of the ARG.
In no case should anything cost money, the top 5% of winners get a physical prize, and progress is tracked using Theorist Points.

Line 70 is skipped, and lines 80 and 90 form an infinite loop, repeating the instruction "\#Put all the theory skills i've given you to the test; x=&lt;Good.Luck.Theorist&gt;".
This string does not represent BASIC code or any recognized programming language, although comments begin with "\#" in many major programming language.

The reverse side is a message signed by MatPat \(with a semicolon in place of an en dash\).
There are five capitalized letters, in order "WATCH".

Embossed into the background is text encoded using the system from [pre:D.Y3](../../pre-arg/d.y3.md).
This text states "the deadly sins / the dwarves of snow white / the deathly hallows" seemingly indicating the number 777 \(seven deadly sins, seven dwarves, seventh Harry Potter book\).

The most likely purpose of this clue was for MatPat to wish all prospective ARG solvers good luck.
