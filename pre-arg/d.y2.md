# D.Y2: gtlive bookshelf

During a stream on GTLive on 09/19, five books were visible on a bookshelf in the back.
The books were as follows:

1. _Content Inc._ by Joe Pulizzi
2. _The Travel Guide to Japan_ \(unknown author\)
3. _Mind = Blown_ by Matthew Santoro
4. _The Physics of Superheroes_ by James Kakalios
5. _Catâ€™s Cradle_ by Kurt Vonnegut

The relevance of these books, or whether they are relevant at all, is undiscovered.

On 09/20, MatPat mentions in the GTLive stream that there are no secrets in the books.
While he may be misleading the community, it is more likely he is telling the truth than lying, so this lead is therefore closed.
