# D.Y6: SuperHot.exe is a VIRUS!

On 10/21, a new Game Theory [video](https://youtu.be/eZXf3p1S5Tk) was released.
During the cold open, the upside-down Game Theory logo appears, indicating that a clue is probably hidden in the video.
This clue has not yet been found.

Some have theorized that the opening crawl text "that's just a theory" vs "that's not just a theory" represents binary and therefore transliterated to

`01010100 01101000 01100101 0100000 0110011 01101100 01110101 01100101 001000 0101001011001101000 0110000 01110101 011001001110000 0110100 0100101`

which, besides the first four characters "the ", has no discernable meaning as of yet.
Theorists have added extra binary to create the 8 necessary to make a letter, but there has been no evidence showing how they got the binary to add in.
