# D.Y3: ◉youareprepared◉

On 09/29, at the date and time listed in [D.E0](d.e0.md), a new [video](https://youtu.be/CPyz8IJTgqE) was uploaded to the tenretni olleh channel \([D.Y1](d.y1-tenretni-olleh.md)\).
It consisted of a distorted Game Theory intro, followed by a message in English \(“Hello Internet.
Are you ready to take the first step? Good.
Great.
So are we.”\), followed by a ciphertext message.

The opening features glitched hexadecimal text on the bottom of the screen at \(0:06 and 0:08\).
The first hex text is `6a 75 6c 79 20 31 35 20 31 39 38 33` which decodes to `july 15 1983`.
The second hex text is `74 68 65 20 66 69 72 73 74 20 31` which decodes to `the first 1`.
07/15/1983 was the release date of the Nintendo Famicom in Japan, the "first" Nintendo game system.

The distorted Game Theory intro also features a binary code \(at 0:13\) on the bricks as Mario runs across the screen.
Using a key \(at 0:14\) saying that red is one and black is zero, it decodes to [https://www.thetheoristgateway.com/notthefirst18fc17.html](https://www.thetheoristgateway.com/notthefirst18fc17.html).

This lead is further explored in \([D.E1](d.e1.md)\).

The five English sentences are written in different colours: green, blue, yellow, purple \(fade to green\), and green.

The final ciphertext message has been decoded as a simple substitution cipher.
The text reads`FIND THE SEARCH - READ THE NOTES - FEAR RABBITS THAT VENTURE INTO HOLES - THE GATES SHALL SUMMON YOU - PATIENCE - AND KNOW THIS - YOUAREPREPARED`The "search" probably refers to the word search \([D.E1](d.e1-notthefirst.md)\) and the notes to the notebook \([D.E2](d.e2.md)\).
Gates are also referred to in the notebook, and rabbit holes are a common ARG term.

For recording purposes, at the beginning of the intro, when the symbols on the logo flash, they repeat a lot.
The sequence is as follows \(A = all, TL = top left, etc.\): TL, BL, BR, TR, A, BR, TR, A, TL, BL, A, A, A, A.

A spectrogram of the video has revealed a key for the cipher with a full alphabet and numeric system.
The spectrogram shows the alphabet, two dots, then the numbers 0-9, then another two dots, then mathematical equations which can be used to deduce the meanings of operators.
This cipher is later used in [D.E1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ODR4aT7x6KT9xr-D9lMoXox9_3Xt86UINMvnhyQJh9o/edit#heading=h.8wa777rdywjp).

The spectrogram also shows text "the one replaced", which probably indicates how to decipher [D.E1](d.e1.md).
