# D.Y0: What is MatPat HIDING?

On 09/16, a [video](https://youtu.be/2KorwsAv49A) was uploaded to the Game Theorists channel entitled "Game Theory: What is MatPat HIDING?" which is considered the trailhead of the ARG.

In the opening seconds of the video, there is a comment with the text
`Uifsf bsf op Fbtufs Fhht jo ifsf.Hp bxbz.`
decoded with ROT1 to `There are no Easter Eggs in here. Go away.`

A cipher was also discovered in the video, `23 5 - 23 15 21 12 4 - 14 15 20 - 13 1 11 5 - 9 20 - 0 8 1 20 - 5 1 19 25`, which decoded to `we would not make it that easy` with an A1Z26 cypher.

Within the tags of the video, as the UUID UCVNTZJXAuvE3C7SfOsPNgEA, another [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVNTZJXAuvE3C7SfOsPNgEA) was discovered \([D.Y1](d.y1.md)\).

During the video, MatPat mentions theorist points.
He also mentions the timestamp 08:52 earlier in the video.
The numbers on-screen at exactly 8:52 are 5325, 7715, and 4792.

Some have speculated the significance of the numbers as anything from digital sums to create a date to trying to interpret as hex or decimal encodings.
It is also likely that this is simply a mistake on YouTube's part as timestamps have been known to be unreliable.

It is likely that all the clues from the video have been discovered, even though there still remains unexplained pieces of information, such as clocks \(at 09:29 showing the times 02:49, 12:03, 04:32, and 02:19\) and counters, which lead the author to believe that this lead is best left closed, especially in light of the new open leads.
