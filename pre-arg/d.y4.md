# D.Y4: The END of Princess Peach

In the Game Theory video posted on 10/06 at around 16:00, the intro from [D.Y3](d.y3.md) was substituted in place of the standard intro.
This is most likely used as a catch up for players who have not yet seen the video on the tenretni olleh channel.

A cipher was hidden in a book at 05:07.
The book had a picture of Princess Peach in an 8-bit style with the text `GWNWWGRC WHFE ZW MCHLEZY SDTBBPW WT` above it.
The cipher was decoded as a Vigenère with the key `TOADSTOOL`.
The plaintext `NINTENDO LORE WE TOTALLY PLANNED IT` appears to be in reference to the Nintendo theme that has prevailed across the ARG thus far.

The video shows a webpage \(0:15\) referring to the "Bowsette" trend.
While they make this reference, bottom left corner shows the following categories:
