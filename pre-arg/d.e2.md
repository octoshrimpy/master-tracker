# D.E2: leave luck to heaven

Continuing from [D.E1](d.e1.md) leads us to [this site](https://www.thetheoristgateway.com/leavelucktoheaven/). This site has a photo of a notepad with all kinds of clues named "youareprepared.jpg". It also contains a hidden element with the text "Patience". It should be noted that the site is actually "leavelucktoheaven" instead of just "lucktoheaven". This reinforces the Nintendo theme, as Nintendo can be loosely translated as "leave luck to heaven".

The CSS sheet that defines the styling for the page has a snippet at the bottom saying "Wow you guys are digging deep. I guess we could put something in here, couldn't we?", indicating that it is entirely possible that future pages' CSS and JavaScript files may have clues hidden within.

Within the EXIF data, the image is titled “Notebook rules - B3”.

The [main image](https://www.thetheoristgateway.com/leavelucktoheaven/youareprepared.jpg) \(clockwise from right, along with the notebook of course\) consists of an iPhone, a Game Theory merch pin \(which appears to be missing its hands\), a Space Invaders alien, a set of coloured sticky tabs and beige sticky notes, a Japanese-make Sakura Pigma ink liner, and 93¢ \(three quarters \(one bicentennial\), one nickel, one dime, and three pennies\) in American change.

The phone has the timestamp 11/24/2018 12:07 listed, indicating that this picture was "taken in the future" - even though in the metadata it says the photo was taken on 09/28/2018 at 17:28. Combined with "merch drops Nov\[ember\]", one can assume that this will be the date of launch for a new set of merch and the next stage of the ARG.

The pen has the hexadecimal text `79 6f 73 68 69` in place of a UPC code. This decodes to `yoshi`.
