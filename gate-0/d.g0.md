# D.G0: gateway

On 11/01, the gateway site updated with new information.
This included a "Getting Started" page and a leaderboard \([D.G1](d.g1.md)\).
The "Getting Started" page included links to this document\(!!\) along with the Discord, subreddit, and Twitter.

The third main page was a "Gates" page which was under construction as of 11/01.
Although the image in the background was greyed out, analysis of the image revealed that the date 11/24 was embedded into the door of Gate 1.
This likely indicates that 11/24 will be the date for the start of the first gate.

The overlaid "Under Construction" [image](https://www.thetheoristgateway.com/tenretniolleh/images/gates/underconstruction_icon.png) contains excess data after the end of the PNG data stream \(marked by `IEND`\). This data,
`well done, young theorist. no clues here, but impressive nonetheless. you are indeed prepared. -MP`,
can be extracted from the image by viewing in any text editor or with the `strings` Unix tool.

The footer contains links to the Game Theory YouTube channel and Creator Ink.

The site makes use of numerous JavaScript and CSS files for the look and feel of the site.
It is highly likely that none of these will have an impact on the ARG.
Bootstrap, jQuery, and Google Tag Analytics are all common JavaScript/CSS libraries.
The script at the bottom is a tracker script provided by GoDaddy.

As of 11/12, the login functionality was completed and a popup now shows with users' names, emails, and Theorist Point scores.
The Theorist Point score for most new accounts is zero, nobody should worry about that.
Personally, this author has run into issues logging in with Firefox, if such issues persist use another browser.

As of 11/21, thetheoristgateway updated once again, changing the layout of the home page and adding “The Toolbox”.
This consists of an uncompleted Google Slides of ways to solve parts of an ARG \(Sound, video, images, etc.\).

On 11/29, the FAQ was also transferred to a Google Slides, which provided definitions for many terms used in the ARG \("keys"/"gates"\).
