# D.G2: gates

![All gates](../assets/0.d.g2.gates.png)

The 11/12 update also brought a new graphic for the seven gates.
These graphics replace the "Under Construction" image and the blurred gates from the original site.

Each gate contains three key icons, indicating that three "keys" will be required to continue past each gate.
The final seventh gate has icons for four keys, indicating a substantial difficulty increase, along with the message "YOU.DON'T.WANT.NONE.OF.THIS"

The gates follow the colour scheme set out in the wireframe from [pre:D.E2](../pre-arg/d.e2.md) and have different themes.
What follows is a framework for theorizing the theme of each gate:

1. Futuristic arch with a video game controllers as gates.
   **Gate 1 was Nintendo-themed.**
2. Minimalist arch reminiscent of Monument Valley and other voxel-/pixel-based games.
3. Classical-inspired arch with what appear to be Doric columns and a traffic stop.
4. Resembles a modern theatre with a metal lighting truss and a red curtain.
   Flanked with GT merch.
5. The set behind the curtain bears a strong resemblance to the GT Live set.
6. Medieval-inspired gate with what could be a key coming from under the gate.
7. Depicts a skull-like cate within a magma room/volcano with a map of the world below.
   May indicate that this gate will require real-life interaction.
