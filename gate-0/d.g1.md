# D.G1: leaderboard

The leaderboard page consists of

Previously, on 11/01, the gateway site updated to be a leaderboard that looks a lot like the wireframe from [pre:D.E2](../pre-arg/d.e2.md).
As the gates had not yet started, all leaderboard entries were fake accounts.
All the times were ∞ and all the keys were 0. The ten fake accounts were:

1. `This Couldbe <YÖU>`
2. `SpaghettiSteph`
3. `MatPatGT <whyamiin3rdplace>`
4. `P33PÅÇ╬µ`
5. `6e6f636c75657368657265`
6. `JÅSON <BLÅME-SQUÅD>`
7. `ÑØSc0ttÝ0uÇantÞlayMYGAME`
8. `GUYS <Seriously>`
9. `Stop»Lookingfor»Clueshere`
10. `FineHeresOneClue <707379636865>`

The hex in 5 is ASCII for `noclueshere` and the hex in 10 is ASCII for `psyche`.
Some have noted that "psyche" is technically not the correct spelling of "sike" \(or "psych"\) and that psyche, pronounced sai-key, is instead a term for the human soul and mind \(think psychology\).
